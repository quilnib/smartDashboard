# smartDashboard

Add a line to the end of the ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart file to call a script
which launches the dashboard on boot.  Currently that looks like:

"bash /home/pi/Documents/smartDashboard/launchDashboard.sh"

update the Dashboard.py file to be executable without "sudo" by doing a "sudo chmod 755 Dashboard.py"
